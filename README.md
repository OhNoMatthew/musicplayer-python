## Description
This is a mini music player made from python. Some tools I have used while making this program are:
- Pygame
- Tkinker

## Instructions
1. Open the file
2. To add songs you must click the add songs button
3. After clicking the add songs button it will open your explorer and choose the folder with Music in it. (The music must be only MP3 Files!)
4. And your music should be added within the green window of the application.
5. The four buttons are in order: (Previous, Play, Pause, Next)

## PATCH NOTES (8/22/2025)
- Fixed the buttons. (They were too big)
